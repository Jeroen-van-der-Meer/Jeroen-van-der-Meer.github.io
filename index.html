		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>
		I am interested in the application of homotopy theory to other branches of mathematics. Historically, homotopy theory was a branch of algebraic topology in which spaces were studied 'up to continuous deformation'; in modern days, however, homotopy theory has grown out of its initial contraints, having proved itself to be spectacularly useful in many other areas of mathematics, such as arithmetic geometry, K-theory, theoretical physics, and even the very foundations of mathematics itself.
		</p>

		<p>
		My research mainly concerned itself with the application of homotopy theory to group theory. Specifically, I proved that certain invariants arising from the modular representation theory of finite groups can be reinterpreted in higher-categorical language, after which I was able to invoke powerful homotopical machinery to explicitly compute these invariants.
